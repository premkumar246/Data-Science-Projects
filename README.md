# Loan Defaulter Prediction Using ML Techniques
## Introduction:
**Machine Learning** helps machines to perform tasks which are complex in nature with out explicitly being coded by any programmer. **Supervised Lerning** is one of the Machine Leanring paradigm which deals with labeled data and help us to build models which can perform task for us. Here is a project **Loan_Defaulter_Prediction** where I have applied supervised leanring and built a model which can predict an applicant can become a defaulter or not. 

'''Python 
def sum(num1,num2):
  return num1+num2
